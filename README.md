Some thoughts for now.

Need to support wav and mp3 as a minimum.
  - wav can be decoded with https://github.com/jussi-kalliokoski/pcmdata.js
  - mp3 can be decoded with https://github.com/nddrylliog/jsmad

Some audio processing might be nice, and here https://github.com/jussi-kalliokoski/audiolib.js might help

Perhaps use https://github.com/joewalnes/smoothie for some nice real-time graphing.
